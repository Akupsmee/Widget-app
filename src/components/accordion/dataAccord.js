It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.',

      'Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromes V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user\'s web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.',
